# go through the current directory finding the directories with a name that
# is equal to and then greater than FIRSTYEAR. Within each of those
# directories, we can look for the existence of directories with names
# that match with the contents of the MONTHS array. Each of these
# directories then may contain a minutes directories which should contain
# all of the minutes tex files. These will be collected in a queue fashion
# so that when they are written to the minutes.tex file, they will appear
# in reverse chronological order so that the most relevant/recent minutes
# appear towards the top of the document.
